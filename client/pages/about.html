<strong style="color: red;">Mr. Punster-pun was sent to this earth on a mission: to make people laugh!  He descended upon Mission Hills, California, near the "City of Angels", in 1987.  At age two, he moved to the deep south, to Hotlanta.  After becoming of age and working at a really boring job, he decided to entertain himself by creating puns.  In the beginning, these puns were very bad.  But his hard work has paid off, and he now has a great collection!  Enjoy them!  Share them!  Laugh!  Laugh!  And.....laugh!</strong>
