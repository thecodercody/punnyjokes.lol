If you've ever dreamed of having the ability to pun people square in the face, you've come to the right place!  The formula for punning is ever so simple!

1 - Say the word out loud or "out loud in your head"
2 - Keep repeating this process over and over while you brainstorm words and/or phrases that sound similar
3 - When you find a match, think of a joke to go with it!
